ABSTRACT
========

$prog - $description

This is a wxPython/Scintilla-based editor written in and extensible
through Python. It attempts to provide an XEmacs-like multi-window,
multi-tabbed interface.



PREREQUISITES
=============

python 2.4 or later
wxPython 2.6.3.2 or later

(Currently developed on Python 2.4.3 and wxPython 2.8.1.1 on Linux, and
Python 2.5 and wxPython 2.8.1.1 on Windows.)



FEATURES
========

* XEmacs feel
* Multiple top-level windows
* AUI widgets for an awesomely awesome, cutting-edge GUI

Many more features are available or planned.  See the roadmap on the
web at http://trac.flipturn.org/roadmap



DOCUMENTATION
=============

See the web at http://www.flipturn.org/peppy



KNOWN ISSUES
============

This editor is still in heavy development, so I wouldn't recommend
that you do anything mission critical with it.  Don't expect it to
actually save your files, although it might if it's in a good mood.
