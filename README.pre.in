ABSTRACT
========

$prog - $description

This is a wxPython/Scintilla-based editor written in and extensible
through Python. It attempts to provide an XEmacs-like multi-window,
multi-tabbed interface.



PREREQUISITES
=============

python 2.4 or later
wxPython 2.6.3.2 or later

(Currently developed on python 2.4.3 and wxPython 2.6.3.3 on Linux and
Windows.)



FEATURES
========

Erm.  It probably won't crash, but I don't think it's going to
contribute to your productivity right now. :)



DOCUMENTATION
=============

Erm again.  Not much yet, either.



KNOWN ISSUES
============

Probably causes hairballs.  Keep cats away.
