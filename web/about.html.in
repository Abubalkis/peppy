<P>This editor is an attempt to displace my dependency on <a
href="http://www.xemacs.org">XEmacs</a>.  My goal is to produce a work-alike
with the feel of emacs but based on <a href="http://www.python.org">Python</a>
using the widget toolkit <a href="http://www.wxpython.org">wxPython</a>.  I
love XEmacs, but my basic problem is this: I don't want to keep space in my
brain to remember Emacs Lisp.

<P>I tend not to write elisp code very much, so when I want to go back and
write an enhancement to XEmacs, I have to try to relearn it.  (This doesn't
even begin to address the fundamental lack of reference guides for elisp
libraries.) Delving into elisp gets less and less appealing as time
goes on and my brain gets filled up with other stuff.

<P>If the editor were written in Python, I'd have no problem blasting out
the enhancement.  Problem is, there are no Python editors that are enough
like XEmacs to make me switch.  There are some IDEs out there that I
like, including <a href="http://www.stani.be/python/spe">SPE</a> and <a
href="http://pype.sourceforge.net">PyPE</a>, but for one reason or another
they haven't convinced me to switch.  For instance, they all want to constrain
me to a single window, and I like the multi-window, multi-tab interface like
Firefox or XEmacs itself.

<P>There are other editors that are in current development,
like <a href="http://www.editra.org">Editra</a> and <a
href="http://code.google.com/p/ulipad/">UliPad</a> but their goals focus on
editing text.  While peppy also aims to be a text editor, like emacs it has
a broader scope by providing major modes that use the MVC paradigm to present
multiple editing interfaces to the same data.

<P>When I talk about XEmacs feel, I mean the usability of the editor itself;
I'm not going for any sort of compatibility with elisp or any of the naming
conventions of the inner workings of XEmacs.  I don't aim to support or
reimplement every elisp packages out there, especially those not related to
editing text like reading email or news or showing phases of the moon or crazy
quotes from Zippy.

<P>Well, except Zippy.  And maybe Psychoanalyze Zippy! And hex edit.  Towers of
Hanoi.  Tetris.  Hangman.  And possibly even phases of the moon.  But not all
at once, and not right away.  First, I'll be focusing on source code editing.

<P>But, hopefully the framework will be easy enough to understand that
contributors like you will want to add a major mode that you liked from XEmacs
and that doesn't exist in peppy.
