<h1>Easy Install</h1>

<P>Peppy is updated at the <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/peppy/">Python
Package Index</a>, and the preferred install method is to use <a
href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools">setuptools</a> to install peppy
into your python site-packages directory.

<P>You may need to be the root user (or have administrator privileges on
Windows) to do this, but at a command line all you need to do to install peppy
is:

<ul>
<li>easy_install -U peppy
</ul>

<P>which will install peppy from scratch or upgrade the peppy currently
residing in your site-packages directory.  It also places a startup program
named "peppy" in a directory that should by default be included in your system
PATH environment.  (Typically, this is the same directory that python itself
is installed into.)

<P>If you don't have setuptools installed, you can install it by downloading
the <a href="http://peak.telecommunity.com/dist/ez_setup.py">ez_setup.py</a>
script and running it, or you can go to the <a
href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools">setuptools</a> homepage to
locate other installers.


<h1>Binary Installers</h1>

<P>Binary installers are self-contained: they do not depend on python or
wxpython being installed on the host system.  Everything you need to run peppy
(including optional modules like pyenchant, NumPy, and GDAL) is contained within
the installer.

<P><strong>Note 1:</strong> Plugins aren't available when using binary
installers.  If you're interested in developing plugins or extending the
functionality of peppy, you should install from source code.

<P><strong>Note 2:</strong> there is no installer for unix-like operating
systems.  You should install using one of the other methods.

<h2>Windows Installer</h2>
<P><a href="http://peppy.flipturn.org/archive/peppy-$version-win32.exe">peppy-$version-win32.exe</a>

<h2>Mac OSX Installer</h2>
<P>coming soon (hopefully)...

<h1>Source Code for Developers</h1>

<P>There are two ways to get the source code: download the current
release, or use subversion to get the current development tree.  In both
cases, however, <a href="http://www.python.org">Python</a> and the <a
href="http://www.wxpython.org">wxPython</a> widget toolkit must be installed
on your system in order to run peppy.

<ul>
<li>Install python following <a href="http://www.python.org/download/">these
instructions</a> for your platform.

<li>Install wxpython following <a
href="http://www.wxpython.org/download.php">these instructions</a> for your
platform.
</ul>

<h2>Unix and Source Code Download</h2>
<dl>
<dt><strong>Recommended:</strong> download current release: <a href="http://peppy.flipturn.org/archive/peppy-$version.tar.bz2">peppy-$version.tar.bz2</a>
<dd>If you're using unix, linux or Mac OSX:
<ul>
<li>tar xvf peppy-$version.tar.bz2
<li>cd peppy-$version
<li>python peppy.py
</ul>
<dd>If you're using windows:
<ul>
<li>extract the archive using winzip, 7zip, or another extractor
<li>go to the extracted folder peppy-$version
<li>double-click on peppy.py
</ul>

<dt><strong>Advanced:</strong> checkout using svn to get the current development tree.
<dd>If you're using unix or linux:
<ul>
<li>svn co http://svn.flipturn.org/peppy/trunk peppy
<li>cd peppy
<li>python peppy.py
</ul>

<dt><strong>Browse:</strong> look at the source code before you download using <a href="http://svn.flipturn.org/peppy/trunk/">svn</a> or <a href="http://trac.flipturn.org/browser/">trac</a>.

</dl>

<P>Older releases are <a href="archive/">archived here</a>.


<h2>Optional Modules</h2>

<dl>
<dt><a href="http://pyenchant.sourceforge.net">pyenchant</a>
<dd>If pyenchant is installed,
text-based major modes will use it to provide on-the-fly spell checking.

<dt><a href="http://numpy.scipy.org/">NumPy 1.0</a>
<dd>Some of the optional major modes like the Hyperspectral Image Viewer
and the Aptus fractal viewer require NumPy, but note that NumPy is
<strong>not</strong> required to run peppy for normal editing.

<dt><a href="http://www.gdal.org/">GDAL 1.5</a>
<dd>The Hyperspectral Image Viewer can also use the GDAL 1.5 libraries to read
images.  GDAL supports a wide range of image formats, including compressed
formats.  Note that you need the new style swig bindings (which are built by
default in GDAL 1.5).

<dt><a href="http://www.scipi.org/">SciPy 0.6</a>

<dd>For even more functionality in the Hyperspectral Image
Viewer, you can install the SciPy library.  SciPy provides a
huge suite of mathematical utility functions and is used in
several image enhancement commands.  However, it is a bit of a <a
href="http://www.scipy.org/Installing_SciPy/BuildingGeneral">complicated
install</a>, involving compiling some libraries by hand.

<p>A problem that plagued me for a while was that the "python
setup.py install" stage was picking up libblas and liblapack from the
system's /usr/lib directory, and RedHat prior to early 2007 supplied
incomplete libraries.  I had to replace these system libraries with my
just-built libraries, because setup.py seemed to ignore the paths I
specified for BLAS and LAPACK as shown in the instructions on the
webpage above.
