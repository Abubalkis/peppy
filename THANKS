The following people have contributed bug fixes or suggestions, and I
appreciate their work.

Thanks to:

* Chris Barker for testing peppy on the Mac and for all the
  suggestions from a fellow emacs user.

* Josiah Carlson for the collaborations on the code I've borrowed from
  PyPE

* Stani Michiels for the pyxides discussions

* Thibauld Nion for the yapsy plugin framework, available at
  http://mathbench.sourceforge.net/yapsy/doc/presentation.html
  under the BSD license, whereas the yapsy code in peppy has been
  infected with the GPL virus and can't be relicensed under BSD.
  However, all changes I make are submitted back upstream to Thibauld
  for possible integration into the BSD-licensed version of yapsy if
  he deems it applicable to the general case.
