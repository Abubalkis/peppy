<P>-- an XEmacs-like editor in Python.  Eventually.

<P>Latest version: $version "$codename".  <a href="download.html">Download here</a>

<P>This project started out as my graduate school thesis, built
as an educational experiment to attempt to demonstrate the <a
href="pm/">modern software development process</a> using the <a
href="http://readyset.tigris.org/">ReadySET project management templates</a>.
However, the code that started out as a means-to-an-end has grown beyond its
original purpose of demonstrating the software development process.  It's now
quite usable and useful.

<P>I suppose you're thinking that the world doesn't need another editor, and
you might even be right.  In fact, a <a href="http://www.xemacs.org">really
good editor</a> does already exist, but I'm not just trying to create another
editor.  I'm looking for a way to build an extensible framework in Python that
can support editing and viewing many different types of files, not <i>just</i>
text files or source code.  But, having said that, the primary target is still
source code editing; however, unlike other editors I'm not <i>limiting</i>
myself to that, as evidenced by the hex edit mode and other esoteric modes
like the hyperspectral image viewer.

<P>A quick summary of features currently provided:

<ul>
<li>Multiple top-level windows
<li>Multiple language support: currently baseline implementations of Python, Makefile, C/C++ major modes
<li>Multiple views of the same file (edit in one view and changes are reflected in realtime in the others, even if the others are different major modes!)
<li>Virtual file system abstraction layer based on <a href="http://www.ikaaro.org/itools/">itools.vfs</a>, allowing transparent file loads from the local file system, http URLs, and from within tar archives without uncompressing the archive beforehand.
<li>Minibuffer ala XEmacs, including tab completion
<li>Other interesting major modes:
<ul>
<li>Hex edit mode
<li>Hyperspectral image view mode
<li>Music Player Daemon mode for controlling an
<a href="http://mpd.wikia.com/wiki/Main_Page">MPD</a> server
</ul>
</ul>

Development features:
<ul>
<li>Pure python source based on the <a href="http://www.wxpython.org">wxPython</a> widget toolkit
<li>Most features coded as plugins - can enable or disable individual features at will
<li>Scintilla styling code borrowed from <a href="http://www.editra.org">Editra</a>
and I will continue to track Editra as more language lexers are supported
</ul>
