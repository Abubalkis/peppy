<P>There will be different ways to download peppy.  Currently, you can download
the raw source code and run it yourself from the command line, but in the
future you'll be able to download installers for windows or Mac OSX and run
them as binary programs.

<h2>Current Source Code</h2>

<P>If you want to look at the source code before you download, you can browse
it online using <a href="http://svn.flipturn.org/peppy/trunk/">svn</a> or
<a href="http://trac.flipturn.org/browser/">trac</a>.

<P>There are two ways to get the source code: download the current release, or
use subversion to get the current development snapshot.

<dl>
<dt><strong>Recommended:</strong> download current release: <a href="http://www.flipturn.org/peppy/archive/peppy-$version.tar.bz2">peppy-$version.tar.bz2</a>
<dd>If you're using unix or linux:
<ul>
<li>tar xvf peppy-$version.tar.bz2
<li>cd peppy-$version
<li>python peppy.py
</ul>
<dd>If you're using windows:
<ul>
<li>extract the archive using winzip, 7zip, or another extracter
<li>go to the extracted folder peppy-$version
<li>double-click on peppy.py
</ul>

<dt><strong>Advanced:</strong> checkout using svn to get the current development snapshot.
<dd>If you're using unix or linux:
<ul>
<li>svn co http://svn.flipturn.org/peppy/trunk peppy
<li>cd peppy
<li>python peppy.py
</ul>
</dl>
