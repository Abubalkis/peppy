multi-tabbed interface.

python (tested under 2.4 only, but might work with others)
wxPython 2.6.3.2



FEATURES
========

Erm.  It probably won't crash, but I don't think it's going to
contribute to your productivity right now. :)



DOCUMENTATION
=============

Erm again.  Not much yet, either.



KNOWN ISSUES
