ABSTRACT
========

$prog - $description

This is a wxPython/Scintilla-based editor and framework written in and
extensible through Python.  It attempts to provide an XEmacs-like
multi-window, multi-tabbed interface.  The architectural goal is to
provide a system with low coupling in order to reduce the work
required to extend the editor with new major modes, minor modes, and
sidebars.



PREREQUISITES
=============

python 2.4 or later
wxPython 2.8 or later

Currently developed on Python 2.4.3 and wxPython 2.8.1.1 on Linux, and
Python 2.5 and wxPython 2.8.1.1 on Windows.

Peppy requires such a new version of wxPython because it's using the
AUI (Advanced User Interface) set of widgets for the main frame and
the notebook.



FEATURES
========

* XEmacs feel
* Multiple top-level windows
* AUI widgets for an awesomely awesome, cutting-edge GUI

Many more features are available or planned.  See the roadmap on the
web at http://trac.flipturn.org/roadmap



DOCUMENTATION
=============

See the web at http://www.flipturn.org/peppy



INSTALLATION
============

This is still alpha software, so caveat emptor.  If you really want to
install the software in the python site-packages directory, see the
file INSTALL in this directory.  Since it is packaged using the
standard Python distutils system, though, you can really just do:

$ python setup.py install

but again I don't necessarily recommend it as this is currently not
what you'd call stable software.



RUNNING THE UNIT TESTS
======================

peppy uses the nose testing framework, available here:

  http://somethingaboutorange.com/mrl/projects/nose/

or if you have setuptools installed, using

$ easy_install nose

Once you have nose installed, you can run the unit tests right out of
the main directory with:

$ nosetests

and hopefully it reports zero errors.



RUNNING THE PROGRAM
===================

If you installed the software, it should have put the command 'peppy'
somewhere in your path, in which case you can start it right from the
command line with:

$ peppy

Probably the better way to run peppy for the moment is not to install
it, but run it right out of the directory that you just unpacked.
This command is simply:

$ python peppy.py



KNOWN ISSUES
============

This editor is still in heavy development, so I wouldn't recommend
that you do anything mission critical with it.  Don't expect it to
actually save your files, although it might if it's in a good mood.
