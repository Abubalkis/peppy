INSTALLATION
============

Unix Installation Instructions
------------------------------

peppy follows the standard python module installation process using
distutils.  It installs the peppy module to site-packages, and the
peppy script to the default binary directory.

Depending on the permissions of your system, you may have to be root
to install.

$ python setup.py install


Windows Installation Instructions
---------------------------------

I'm currently not providing a windows installer, but that might change
in the future.  For now, just follow the Unix installation
instructions.  There are no compiled extensions, so there shouldn't be
any differences between the two installation procedures.
