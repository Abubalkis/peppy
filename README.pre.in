ABSTRACT
========

$prog - $description

This is a wxPython/Scintilla-based editor and framework written in and
extensible through Python.  It attempts to provide an XEmacs-like
multi-window, multi-tabbed interface.  The architectural goal is to
provide a system with low coupling in order to reduce the work
required to extend the editor with new major modes, minor modes, and
sidebars.



FEATURES
========

* XEmacs feel

* Multiple top-level windows

* AUI widgets for an awesomely awesome, cutting-edge GUI

* Interesting major modes like:

  * MPDMode for controlling a Music Player Daemon instance.  Point it
    to a music player daemon instance using the url mpd://host[:port]
    where the port will default to 6600 if you don't specify it.

  * HSIMode for viewing hyperspectral image files
 

Many more features are available or planned.  See the roadmap on the
web at http://trac.flipturn.org/roadmap



DOCUMENTATION
=============

Currently a bit lacking.  See the web at http://www.flipturn.org/peppy
for what's available.



PREREQUISITES
=============

python 2.4 or later
wxPython 2.8 or later

Currently developed on Python 2.5.1 and wxPython 2.8.4.0 on Linux, and
Python 2.5 and wxPython 2.8.6.0 on Windows.

Peppy requires such a new version of wxPython because it's using the
AUI (Advanced User Interface) set of widgets for the main frame and
the notebook.


Optional Modules
----------------

The optional hyperspectral image view mode has additional
requirements:

numpy 1.0 or later

and additional functionality will be enabled if it finds:

scipy 0.5.2 or later
gdal 1.4.0 or later

Without GDAL support, only raw image formats like ENVI are available.
GDAL provides image loading capability for a wide variety of formats,
including compressed images.  To use GDAL support, the ngpython swig
bindings must be used when compiling the module.  See the file INSTALL
for more information.



INSTALLATION
============

This is still alpha software, so caveat emptor.  I recommend just
running it out of the directory in which the software was unpacked.

If you really want to install the software in the python site-packages
directory, see the file INSTALL in this directory.  Since it is
packaged using the standard Python distutils system, though, you can
really just do:

$ python setup.py install

but again I don't necessarily recommend it as this is currently not
what you'd call stable software.



RUNNING THE UNIT TESTS
======================

peppy uses the nose testing framework, available here:

  http://somethingaboutorange.com/mrl/projects/nose/

or if you have setuptools installed, using

$ easy_install nose

Once you have nose installed, you can run all the unit tests by
running

$ noserun.sh

in the tests/ directory.



RUNNING THE PROGRAM
===================

If you installed the software, it should have put the command 'peppy'
somewhere in your path, in which case you can start it right from the
command line with:

$ peppy

Probably the better way to run peppy for the moment is not to install
it, but run it right out of the directory that you just unpacked.
This command is simply:

$ python peppy.py



KNOWN ISSUES
============

This editor is still in heavy development, so I wouldn't recommend
that you do anything mission critical with it.  It tends to be in a
good mood most of the time and therefore is likely save your files,
but it might crash unexpectedly.
