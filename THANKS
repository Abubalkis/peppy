The following people have contributed bug fixes or suggestions, and I
appreciate their work.

Thanks to:

* Chris Barker for testing peppy on the Mac and for all the
  suggestions from a fellow emacs user.

* Josiah Carlson for the collaborations on the code I've borrowed from
  PyPE

* Stani Michiels for the pyxides discussions

* Thibauld Nion for the yapsy plugin framework, available at
  http://mathbench.sourceforge.net/yapsy/doc/presentation.html
  under the BSD license, whereas the yapsy code in peppy has been
  infected with the GPL virus and can't be relicensed under BSD.
  However, all changes I make are submitted back upstream to Thibauld
  for possible integration into the BSD-licensed version of yapsy if
  he deems it applicable to the general case.
  
* Cody Precord for the code borrowed from Editra, his editor project.
  He came up with a styling system that maps a single style sheet to all
  scintilla modes, making the styling consistent across all supported
  languages.  So, for example, a comment style in one language is
  the same as a comment style in another language.


Additional thanks to:

* Robin Dunn for the omnipresence on the wxPython mailing list and the
  feature list on his blog

  contributions on the wxPython wiki

* Mark James for the free silk icon set

* The Natural Language Toolkit project (http://nltk.sourceforge.net)
  for the chatbot implementations

* Nick Welch for the implementation of an mpd client for python
  (http://incise.org/index.cgi/py-libmpdclient2)
  
* Peter Damoc for the suggestions and feedback on the subprocess
  control features
