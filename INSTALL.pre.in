INSTALLATION
============

Unix Installation Instructions
------------------------------

peppy follows the standard python module installation process using
distutils.  It installs the peppy module to site-packages, and the
peppy script to the default binary directory.

Depending on the permissions of your system, you may have to be root
to install.

$ python setup.py install


Windows Installation Instructions
---------------------------------

I'm currently not providing a windows installer, but that might change
in the future.  For now, just follow the Unix installation
instructions.  There are no compiled extensions, so there shouldn't be
any differences between the two installation procedures.



INSTALLING OPTIONAL MODULES
===========================

If using the hyperspectral image viewing capabilities of peppy, numpy
*must* be installed, and scipy and gdal can optionally be installed.

Installing NumPy
----------------

The numerical python library, NumPy (numpy.scipi.org) is installed
like a typical python module: by downloading it and running

$ python setup.py install

You may have to be root to complete the installation.

Installing SciPy
----------------

SciPy is a bit more complicated of an install, as it depends on the
BLAS and LAPACK libraries.  The SciPy website has instructions here:

http://www.scipy.org/Installing_SciPy/BuildingGeneral

which is, unfortunately, a bit more complicated than just "python
setup.py install" but is relatively straight-forward.  In general, you
can just follow those instructions.

However, a problem that plagued me for a while was that the "python
setup.py install" stage was picking up libblas and liblapack from the
system's /usr/lib directory, and RedHat prior to early 2007 supplied
incomplete libraries.  I had to replace these system libraries with my
just-built libraries, because setup.py seemed to ignore the paths I
specified for BLAS and LAPACK as shown in the instructions on the
webpage above.

Installing GDAL
---------------

To take advantage of the variety of image formats that GDAL supports,
you can install it as well.  Download from www.gdal.org and uncompress
in a directory.  The setup is a bit more complicated than a typical
python module:

$ cd gdal-1.4.1
$ ./configure --without-python --with-ngpython
$ make
$ cd swig/python
$ python setup.py install
